# Intro

- Mother tongue is chinese
- English is favorite (C1)
- German helps thinking (C1)
- Recently, I've found out a great language learning tool called "language reactor", a plugin in chrome and other browsers.
    - Work together with Youtube, Netflix. With machine/human translation of subtitle and can add vocabulary in your account. Later, you can export the vocabulary with its media (picture, audio) to Anki, csv and so on.
    - I'm watching Big Bang (English) and Dark (German) and collecting words and phrases. And then I export them to my Anki and repeat them. It's easy because there are audios with the words and pictures.
